        <p>Aropia was founded in 2021 by Aaron & Abagail Piach. They were
          discovering islands and small land masses near Japangea, this is when
          they stumbled across a large island uninhabited. The Piach's made the
          decision to create a public community and allow others to reside in
          the island. The official language is English, but most Japangeans live
          here.</p>
